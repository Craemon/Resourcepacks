# Craemon Resourcepack MonoRepo
This repository includes most of my resourcepacks. This is done to reduce the insane amount of tiny repositories I had before. It also provides an easy way of version updating them (provided no major changes apply to them). This is achieved by using my terminal app [Packtools](https://github.com/Craemon/Packtools). It allows me to reuse common files across multiple packs by merging multiple directories on build and creating a Test instance in Prism Launcher.
